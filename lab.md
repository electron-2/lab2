*Lab written by Pat Hanrahan*

![Below C Level](images/belowClevel.jpg)

From Death Valley, CA.

## Goals

During this lab you will:

1. Understand the assembly language produced by `gcc` when compiling a C program.

2. Understand basic `Makefile`s.

3. Learn how to unit test your C program.

3. Setup up a 4-digit 7-segment display 
   for your next assignment - building a clock.

## Prelab preparation

To prepare for this lab, you should do the following.

1. Read our [gcc guide](/guides/gcc)
   about how to compile C programs for bare metal
   programming on the Raspberry Pi.

2. Read our [make guide](/guides/make)
   on setting up makefiles for cross-development
   on the Pi.

3. Read [section 4.1 of this lab](#crossref) on the theory of operation
   for 7-segment displays. It may also help to skim the rest of section 4

4. Clone the lab repository found at `https://github.com/cs107e/lab2`

You will be doing a lot of breadboarding in the this lab. If you have your own tools (strippers, pliers, etc.), please bring them! We will have tools to share, but it can be extra-empowering to work with your own tools.

## Lab exercises

Pull up the lab [checklist](checklist) for the questions for which we want you to jot down answers and discuss with the TA when checking out at the end of lab. We don't grade you on correctness or collect your answers; we check in with each of you to make sure you've completed the lab and understand the concepts.

### 1. C to assembly (20 min)

The goal of this exercise is to understand how C is translated 
into assembly language. You won't likely hand-code that much assembly, but you will often spend time __reading__ assembly, so the focus is on gaining reading familiarity.

We want you to have an understanding of 
how the compiler generates assembly from C
and be able to inspect that assembly to better understand 
the execution of a program.
As we will see, sometimes the assembly
produced by the C compiler can be surprising. 
Using your ARM superpowers, you can dig into the generated 
assembly and figure out what the compiler did, instead of sitting 
there dumbfounded when an executing program does not behave as expected!

Go to the `lab2/code/codegen` directory. Open the `codegen.c` source file in
your text editor. The file contains four parts that explore different aspects of C: arithmetic, if/else, loops, and pointers.

Skim the C code and read the comments we provide. To see how that C is translated by the compiler, you can run `make` and  open the `codegen.list` file, but it's a bit faster (and definitely more fun!) to
play with the online Compiler Explorer we used in lecture.

Bring up the [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/g/NXucLN) in a browser window. Choose the compiler `ARM gcc 5.4.1 (none)` and enter flags `-Og -ffreestanding -marm`.  This gives you a close approximation of our compiler version/environment (although not an exact match). Paste each part
from `codegen.c` into the Compiler Explorer window and read through the generated assembly to understand the compiler's translation. Use the comments in the C source code as your guide for what to watch for. 

Keep in mind that a great way to learn how a system works is by trying
things. Curious about some C code is translated to assembly? Try it out and see. Let your curiosity be your guide!

### 2. Makefiles (15 min)

Break into pairs and read the following Makefile.

```
    NAME = blink

    CFLAGS = -g -Wall -Og -std=c99 -ffreestanding
    LDFLAGS = -nostdlib -e main

    all: $(NAME).bin
     
    %.bin: %.elf
        arm-none-eabi-objcopy $< -O binary $@

    %.elf: %.o
        arm-none-eabi-gcc $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

    %.o: %.c
        arm-none-eabi-gcc $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
    
    %.list: %.o
        arm-none-eabi-objdump -d $< > $@

    install: $(NAME).bin
        rpi-install.py $<

    clean:
        rm -f *.o *.elf *.bin *.list
```

Discuss and document all the various features and syntactical
constructs used in this Makefile.

 - What do each of the CFLAGS do?
 - What happens if you just type `make`? Which commands will execute?
 - If you modify blink.c and run `make` again, which commands will rerun?
What part of each target indicates the prerequisites? (A prerequisite means 
that if that file changes, then the target is stale and must be rebuilt)
 - What do the symbols `$<` and `$@` mean?

You should be able to answer the [first checklist question](checklist) now.

### 3. Testing (15 min)

As you write more complicated programs, you'll want to test
them; keeping track of what parts of the program work and what parts don't is essential
to debugging effectively. Starting with assignment 2, we'll provide you with some 
automated tests and tools you can use to write your own tests.
Let's walk through a simple example with tests.

#### A buggy program

Go to the `lab2/code/testing` directory in your terminal.

Look at the simple program in `testing.c` that defines a (buggy) `is_odd` function. The `main()` function is tries `is_odd` on a variety of inputs and uses `assert()` to validate that the result was correct.  If result was correct, the assert succeeds and the program continues on normally. If the result was incorrect, the assert fails and raises an error. 

We can use `assert()` to test that our program is working as expected.
If we pass in an expression that we're *expecting* to be true and `assert()` throws an error, we know that we have a bug
in our program. If our program is working correctly, our assert statements should return smoothly.

#### Build the program

Now run `make`.

Running `make` will generate both `testing.bin` and
 `testing.list`. To produce `testing.bin`, the computer needs to
_compile_ `testing.c` to `testing.o`, then _link_ that `.o` with some
other object files to form `testing.elf`, then strip that down to
`testing.bin`. We will learn more about linking later.

This Makefile is also configured to build a `testing.list` file that contains the text of the ARM assembly instructions compiled from the `testing.c` C source file.

Whenever you make a change to your program, run `make` again to rebuild the program from the changed files and generate a new assembly list file.

#### What do you expect?

Before we run the program, let's think about what we expect to
happen. The `assert` macro (in `assert.h`) will call `abort` if its 
argument evaluates to false, but what does `abort` do? (hint: look in `abort.c`)

Next, look at `cstart.c` and determine what will happen if your
program returns from `main()` without an assertion failure (i.e., what
will happen if the program works!). Don't worry about the `bss` stuff
for now: we will talk about that in class soon.

__If `is_odd()` has a bug, what would you expect to see on the Pi? In
contrast, what would you expect to see on the Pi if `is_odd()` worked
properly?__


#### Run the program

Run `rpi-install.py testing.bin`. You should get the blinking red
LED of doom. You now know at least one test failed, but which one?
The strategy from here is to iterate, selectively commenting in/out 
test cases and re-running to narrow in on which specific cases fail. 
How many of the test cases pass? How many fail?  Which ones? Why?

Use the information you glean from the test cases to identify what is wrong.
Now fix the bug in `is_odd` so that it works correctly for any argument.
Uncomment all test cases, rebuild, re-run, and bask in the glow of the green light of happiness!

#### Make install

Phew, typing out `rpi-install.py testing.bin` so many times was
incredibly taxing on your poor fingers! Try adding a recipe for
`install` to your Makefile that allows you to build and a run
a test program on your Pi with the single command `make install`.

### 4. Wire up display breadboard (70 min)

Your next assignment will be to build a simple clock
using a 4-digit 7-segment display. This lab will get you
set up to do this.

This lab exercise has been deliberately designed to step you 
through the process and has you test each stage as you go. 
A "test as you go" strategy is the hallmark of a great engineer, please follow along carefully!

#### 4.1) How the display works

Let's start by understanding how a single 7-segment display works.

![7-segments](images/segments.png) 

The 7-segment display, as its name implies,
is comprised of 7 individually lightable LEDs,
labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.
There is also a decimal point labeled DP.
Each segment is an LED. 
Recall that an LED has an anode and a cathode.
The polarity matters for an LED;
the anode voltage must be positive relative to the
cathode for the LED to be lit.
If the cathode is positive with respect to the anode,
the segment is not lit.

On the 7-segment displays we are using,
the cathodes are all connected together. Such a display is called a *common cathode* display.

![Common Cathode](images/common.cathode.png)



To display a digit, you turn on the appropriate segments. Turning on all the segments would display the digit `8`. Which segments do you need to turn on to display the digit `1`, the digit `0`, the letter `A`?

Here is a
[nice online simulation of a 7-segment display](http://www.uize.com/examples/seven-segment-display.html).

Your clock will display minutes and seconds.
We will need 2 digits for the minutes and 2 digits for the seconds,
for a total of 4 digits.
We will be using a display with four 7-segment displays integrated into a single unit, as shown in the photo below:

[<img src="images/display.jpg" title="4-digit, 7-segment display" width="200">](images/display.jpg)

Here is a more detailed diagram of the package:

[<img title="4-digit, 7-segment display" src="images/display.package.png" width="600">](images/display.package.png)

And here is its schematic:

[<img title="4-digit, 7-segment display" src="images/display.schematic.png" width="600">](images/display.schematic.png)

Study these diagrams.
There are 12 pins in total: 4 digit pins and 8 segment pins.
The 4 digit pins are
labeled DIG.1, DIG.2, DIG.3, and DIG.4. The 8 segment pins are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, DP.
Notice how the pins are internally wired to the LEDs.
Each digit is an individual common cathode 7-segment display.
The segments (A-G) are wired to all 4 digits.
The cathode for each digit has a separate pin.

Here is a handy photo of the display with the pins labeled. Note that DIG.1,
DIG.2, DIG.3, and DIG.4 have been renamed to D1, D2, D3, and D4.
<a name="pinout"></a>
![4-digit, 7-segment display](images/display.labeled3.jpg)

The pins also have numbers.
The pin on the bottom-left is numbered 1,
and the numbers increase as you move right up to 6,
and then continue around on the top.
Note that pin 12 is in the top-left corner.

#### 4.2) Wire up resistors/segments

In this step, you are going to wire up the segments of the display and turn them on. For ease of debugging, we recommend that you first wire up the display using jumper cables. After validating your circuit, then you can re-wire it in a more neat and permanent fashion.

First, connect the two power rails and two ground rails on your breadboard. This makes
accessing power and ground via jumpers more convenient. My convention is to always orient my breadboard so that 
the blue ground rail is on the bottom 
(after all, ground is always underneath us).

![Breadboard with two wires](images/power-rails.jpg)

Second, insert the display on the right side of the breadboard.
Make sure the display is oriented correctly
(the decimal points should be on the bottom,
and the digits slanted to the right). We chose to place our display so __pin 1 of the display
is aligned with column 50 on the breadboard__. This makes it easier to know which numbered hole 
is connected to a pin,
since after you insert the display into the breadboard 
you can't see the pins.

Third, place a single 1K resistor on the board. Install it so that it crosses over the middle of the breadboard. Clip the ends so that it sits neatly.

Hook up the power and ground rails of the breadboard
to the 3.3V and Ground pins on your Raspberry Pi.
Find three short male-male jumpers.
Wire the top of the resistor to the red power rail 
using an orange jumper (since orange indicates 3.3V) and wire a green jumper from the bottom of the resistor to segment A (Pin 11, which will be at breadboard column 51 if you aligned pin 1 to column 50 as described above).
Wire digit D1 (Pin 12, column 50) to Ground using a black jumper.
When you apply power to your Raspberry Pi, segment A of digit 1 should light up as shown below:

![Wired breadboard with components](images/jumper1.jpg)

You can light up other segments on the display by moving your jumpers around. Use the [labeled photo above](#pinout) to review the display pinout. Rewire your segment jumper to light up segment B instead of segment A. Rewire your digit jumper to light up segment B of digit 2 instead of digit 1. Add an additional digit jumper to light up segment B of **both** digits 1 and 2.
Note that you cannot simultaneously display different segments on different digits: Why not?

Now neatly place eight 1K resistors in a row on your breadboard.
Use the convention 
that the leftmost resistor controls segment A
and the rightmost controls segment DP.
After you insert the resistors, test your circuit.  Simultaneously wiring up all segments with 8 jumper cables can be messy, instead use a pair of jumpers to wire up 2 segments at a time and move the jumpers to test all 8. As you go, you may want to make a sketch of the correct connection between each resistor and its display pin you can refer to when wiring up the permanent circuit. 

Before moving on to the next step, wire up your jumpers to display the pattern `"1 1 "`.
Here a space means that the digit is blank (no segments turned on).

![Wired breadboard with components](images/jumper2.jpg)

#### 4.3) Wire up transistors/digits

Up to now, you have been controlling whether a digit is on by adding or removing a jumper that connects the digit pin to ground.
We eventually want to control which segments and digits 
are turned on using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins,
so we need an electronic switch that can be controlled using these pins.
To do this we will use bipolar-junction transistors, or BJTs. 

A transistor has 3 terminals— the base (B), collector (C), and emitter (E).
The base controls 
the amount of current flowing from the collector to the emitter.
Normally, no current flows from collector to emitter.
This condition is an open circuit.
However, if you apply 3.3V to the base, 
the collector will be connected to the emitter and current will flow.
This is equivalent to closing the switch.

We will be using 2N3904 transistors.
The following diagram identifies which
pins on the 2N3904 are collector, base, and emitter.

![2n3904](images/2n3904.jpg)

Note the transistors have a flat side and a rounded side.
If you are looking at the flat side with the legs pointing down,
the leftmost leg will be the emitter.

Instead of wiring a digit pin directly to ground as before, the digit pin connects to the collector of a transistor whose emitter is connected to ground. Applying power to the transistor base activates the switch and grounds the digit pin.

First, disconnect all direct connections from your digit pins from ground. Place a row of 4 transistors in your breadboard to the left of the resistors. The leftmost transistor will control digit pin D1; the rightmost digit pin D4. 

Now let's connect up the leftmost transistor. Wire the collector to D1 and the emitter to ground. Connect the base to the control voltage through a 1K current-limiting resistor.

Apply power to the base of the transistor.
You should see `"1 ‍ ‍ ‍ "` on the display.

Here's a board where we've connected _both_ D1 and D3 to the
collectors of transistors and applied power to the bases of
those two transistors, so we see `"1 1 "` on the display.

![Wired breadboard with components](images/jumper3.jpg)

#### 4.4) Permanently wire circuit

Now comes the time-consuming part.
Each segment pin needs to be connected to its resistor and each digit pin connected to the collector of its transistor. 
Be patient, this takes some time.
However, if it's taking you more than half an hour in lab, try moving on and coming back to this part.

Here is a photo of what it should look like before wiring.

![Wired breadboard with components](images/parts.jpg)

And below is what it should look like when it's all wired up, except
for the GPIO pins on the Pi.

In the diagram below, two dots with the same color are connected by a
wire. The GPIO pin numbers are placed where you should connect jumpers
from the pins on the Pi. The vertical white line marks row 50
on the breadboard, which is where the leftmost pin of the 7-segment
display would be if you placed it according to our advice earlier in
this lab.

You will see some buttons in the photo. There is no need to add those
buttons during lab.  The buttons are used for the extension to
Assignment 2.

![Wired breadboard with components 2](images/wire2.jpg)

Here's the full breadboard hard-wired to test one segment and digit.

![Wired breadboard with components 1](images/wire1.jpg)

#### 4.5) Connect to Raspberry Pi

The final step is to connect the display to the GPIOs of your Raspberry Pi so you can control the display with a program.
We will outline the process in the next few paragraphs.
However, there is no need to do this in lab.
You should be able to do this on your own outside of lab.

We will use GPIOs 10-13 to control the 4 digits.
GPIO 10 will control the first digit,
GPIO 11 will control the second digit, and so on.
We will dedicate GPIOs 20-27 to control 
the 8 segments (A-G and DP).
GPIO 20 will control segment A, GPIO 21 will control segment B, etc.
In total, we will use 12 GPIOs on the Pi:
8 to control which segments are turned on,
and 4 to control which digits are turned on.

Setting the segment GPIOs high and low determines which segments will light up. Similarly, setting the digit GPIOs turns the transistors on and off to control which digits light up.
When you implement your clock,
you will write a program that will 
first display digit 0,
then it will turn off digit 0 and turn on digit 1, 
and so on.
Add some logic to keep track of time,
and you have a clock!

The extension for this assignment challenges you to provide a UI to the clock
that lets you set the time.
You are constrained to use only 2 buttons.
Here is how we wired up 2 buttons on our breadboard.

![Buttons](images/button.jpg)

## Checkoff with TA

Make sure you [check off](checklist) with a TA before you leave.

## For later

After this lab, on your own time, you may try the following:

1. Finish any parts of `codegen.c` you didn't complete during lab.
2. Go through the Makefile in the `testing/` subdirectory of `code/`.
3. Finish wiring up your beautiful clock breadboard.
